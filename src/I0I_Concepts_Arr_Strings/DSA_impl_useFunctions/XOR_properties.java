        XOR properties that how it basically returns the elements

            0 | 0 = 0
            0 | 1 = 1
            1 | 1 = 0
            1 | 0 = 1

        in this it basically provide output of non repetitive elements
        but only gives one element if we give two single nums then
        it returns the sum of it.
