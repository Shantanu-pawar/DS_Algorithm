## limitations of arrays
___

1. we don't able to  insert the numbers once we finish the arr size. 
and insert all elements
2. Array is fixed size data structure.

## what is linkedList
___
`defination` : linked-list is linear data structure
that we can grow and shrink at run time. it's a collection of multiple nodes which are 
linked to each other. <br>
in LinkedList each node contains some data, and reference pointer to the next node.

<br>

`Question : what is the use of tail in linkedlist?` <br>
if we want to insert node at last so by using tail, we can add at 
constant time `i.e. O(1)` <br>
otherwise we will take `O(N)` time.
<br> <br>

`features | advantages of linkedlist ?` <br>
linked-lists are dynamic in nature, and their size is adjusted according to our requirement.

### uses of linkedlist in real life.
___
1. various data structure can be implemented using linked list such as stacks | Queues | hashmap etc.
2. memory consumption of linked list is efficient as it's size can grow and shrink accordingly to requirement.

### Also remember to practice
___
* insertion at any position
* deletion of nodes

on circular, singly, doubly linkedlist
