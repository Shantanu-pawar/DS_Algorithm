//     there are two approaches
//    1. O(NÂ²) - two for loops and check it iteratively set first loop to 0 to [n-1] and 2nd [i+1 to n]

//    2. using hashset store the number's and check the counter each time and if it is present
//    in set or not O(N) time and space both
//      as we know a + b = sum || sum - a = b [so in map we're storing b and check each time of map contains it ?]
