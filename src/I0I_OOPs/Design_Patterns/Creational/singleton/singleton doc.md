# All about singleton

notes : solid design pattern allow us to create really robust and scalable code  


how object will be created ? 
so when we required to create only one single object
for entire session 

so let's take example : 
if m logging any website so in that those website have to maintain those 
login sessions so they have to create one session object

so in real time application we've to create 
only one session for user


purpose : 
the main purpose of using this pattern is to have only 
single object to create the client
