## limitations of arrays

1. we don't able to  insert the numbers once we finish the arr size. 
and insert all elements
2. Array is fixed size data structure.

## what is linkedList
`defination` : linked-list is linear data structure used to store collection of elements
that we can grow and shrink at run time.

it's a collection of multiple nodes which are linked to each other. <br>
in LinkedList each node contains some data, and reference pointer to the next node.

<br>

`Question : what is the use of tail in linkedlist?` <br>
if we want to insert node at last so by using tail, we can add at 
constant time `i.e. O(1)` <br>
otherwise we will take `O(N)` time.
<br> <br>

`features | advantages of linkedlist ?` <br>
1. linked-lists are dynamic in nature, and their size is adjusted according to our requirement.
2. memory consumption of linkedlist is efficient as it's asize can grow or shrink dynamically 
according to our requirement.

`dis Advantages ?` <br>
A node in linked list occupies more memory than an element in array as each node
occupies at least two information like data and next node's reference variable.


### uses of linked-list in real life.
___
various data structure can be implemented using linked list such as stacks | Queues | hashmap etc.

### Also remember to practice
___
* insertion at any position
* deletion of nodes

on circular, singly, doubly linkedlist
